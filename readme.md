TTLO Environment & PDIML Algorithm
Overview
This repository contains two key components:

TTLO Environment: A custom Gym environment designed to address the Task-To-Optimization (TTO) problem using a novel reconceptualization approach.
PDIML Algorithm: A novel first-order gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithm for high-speed rail (HSR) operation tasks, combining Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Policy Deviation Integre (PDI) and Reptile meta-learning.
